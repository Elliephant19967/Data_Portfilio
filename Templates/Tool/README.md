# SQL Projects

This directory contains projects demonstrating my proficiency in **SQL** for data extraction, cleaning, wrangling, and analysis. The projects showcase a progression from fundamental querying to advanced techniques like Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and stored procedures.

My approach to data is informed by my background in psychology; I focus not just on retrieving data, but on ensuring it is valid, reliable, and structured to answer meaningful questions about behavior and systems.
